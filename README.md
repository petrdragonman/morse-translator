# Title morse-translator

## Demo & Snippets

-   N/A

## Requirements / Purpose

-   Outline
This task will require you to create a web page Morse Code translator. The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

-   MVP
Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
Create JS functions that would allow the user to:
translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to add tests for all your translate logic, you want to have some pure functions that take an input and return that input translated
Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

-  BONUS
Auto-detect the language
